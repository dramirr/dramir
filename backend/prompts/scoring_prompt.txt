SCORING SYSTEM EXPLANATION

This document explains how the graduated scoring system works in TalentRadar v2.

NOTE: Scoring is performed by Python code (scoring_service.py), not by AI.

=== SCORING STRATEGIES ===

1. RANGED NUMBER SCORING
   Used for: age, years of experience, language percentage
   
   Example: Work Experience (20 points)
   - 10+ years → 100% (20 points) - Expert level
   - 5-9 years → 85% (17 points) - Senior level
   - 2-4 years → 60% (12 points) - Qualified level
   - 0-1 years → 15% (3 points) - Junior level

2. GRADED CATEGORY SCORING
   Used for: skill levels (Excel, Sepidar, Office)
   
   Example: Excel Skills (8 points)
   - Advanced → 100% (8 points)
   - Intermediate → 65% (5.2 points)
   - Basic → 20% (1.6 points)
   - None → 0% (0 points)

3. BOOLEAN SCORING
   Used for: yes/no experience questions
   
   Example: Financial Reports Experience (2 points)
   - Has experience → 100% (2 points)
   - No experience → 0% (0 points)

4. TEXT MATCHING SCORING
   Used for: education field, industry type
   
   Example: Education Field (10 points)
   - Matches required keywords → 100% (10 points)
   - No match → 0% (0 points)

=== AGGREGATE SCORING ===

Total Score = Sum of all awarded points
Max Score = Sum of all maximum points
Percentage = (Total Score / Max Score) × 100

Status:
- Qualified: Percentage >= Threshold (default 75%)
- Rejected: Percentage < Threshold

=== ASSESSMENT GENERATION ===

The system automatically generates an assessment based on:
- Overall percentage score
- Number of strong criteria (score ≥ 80%)
- Number of weak criteria (score < 50%)
- Comparison to threshold

Example Assessments:
- 90%+: "Excellent candidate - Exceeds requirements significantly"
- 80-89%: "Strong candidate - Meets all key requirements"
- 75-79%: "Qualified candidate - Meets minimum requirements"
- Below threshold: "Below threshold by X percentage points"

=== FAIRNESS PRINCIPLES ===

1. Graduated scoring recognizes different experience levels
2. Partial credit given for near-misses
3. Excellence rewarded (10 years > 2 years)
4. Transparent reasoning for each score
5. Configurable ranges per position
